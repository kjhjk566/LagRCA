## 📝 Dataset

D1 is derived from a production-grade, high-fidelity microservice system deployed on the cloud infrastructure of a top-tier commercial bank.
The system consists of 46 microservice instances running across multiple virtual machines and follows realistic e-commerce traffic patterns observed in daily operations.
The dataset covers five representative infrastructure failure categories frequently encountered in practice, including CPU Anomaly, Memory Exhaustion, Service Interruption, Storage Capacity, and I/O Contention.
Each collected record is annotated with the corresponding root-cause instances and failure categories.

D2 is built on Online Boutique, a widely used open-source microservice benchmark deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. It contains 41 microservice instances and represents a standard cloud-native architecture. To obtain precise ground truth and controlled failure scenarios, we inject faults spanning the entire stack, comprehensively covering infrastructure-level issues (Network, Storage, Resource Stress, and Pod Lifecycle) as well as application-level anomalies (JVM Runtime and Application Logic errors).

We have preprocessed two raw datasets and placed them in the following folder.

D1: LagRCA/data/D1

D2: LagRCA/data/D2

The preprocessed dataset contains the following files:

- `normal_data.pkl`: Multivariate time-series data under normal (non-failure) conditions for all microservice instances.
- `case_data.pkl`: Multivariate time-series data for failure cases, typically covering a 20-minute time window around each incident, including metrics and corresponding labels.
- `adj.pkl`: Adjacency matrix describing the call graph / dependency structure among microservice instances, used to construct the graph for LagRCA.
